# Boltraz
This is a personal pet project. Boltraz is an application for the students of a university to manage and navigate through their daily college activity. 

A lightweight, full fledged course/college navigator application for Android built for students. From managing courses, receiving department and class announcements, timetables and registering yourselves for college events everything under your fingertips. Built as a part of CodeSpace by DevSpace - A national level hackathon hosted by Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore. The alpha builds have been rolled out unofficially and the final product will be on its production stage soon.
